    "So, we have a deck of 36 cards. Each of us will receive 6 cards. The rest of the deck is placed face down - this will be our draw deck"

    "The top card of the deck is turned over and placed face down under the deck - this will be the trump. The suit of this card determines which suit will be the main one in this game."

    "The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards. Whoever is left with cards in their hands at the end of the game is a fool! Logical, right?"

    "The course of the game begins with the one who has the smallest trump card in their hand."

    "The dignity of the cards is determined as follows (from the lowest to the highest): from 6 to 10, jack, queen, king, ace."

    "For example, your lowest trump is a six, and I have either higher or no trump at all, then you move."

    "You can play one or more cards of the same value. For example, if you have two jacks, you can play both of them."

    'The next player must "beat back". This means they must play a higher-ranking card of the same suit, or a trump if they are beating a card of a non-trump suit.'

    'And trumps are beaten only by higher-ranking trumps. Beaten cards are placed in a separate pile face down.'

    'If they cannot or do not want to beat back, they take all the cards from the table for themselves.'

    'After the attack is beaten back or accepted, all players draw cards from the deck up to six. If the deck is exhausted, then the players simply continue to play with what they have in their hands.'

    'Now for the fun part: Transferring and tossing!'

    'If you have a card of the same value as the card that was thrown at you, you can "transfer" the move by placing this card next to it. Then I will have to fight back.'

    "And the toss! After I fight, you can toss cards of the same value that are already on the table."

    "The game continues until one player runs out of cards. He is considered the winner, and the other is the loser, that is, a fool."

    "As the game progresses, everything will become much clearer!"
